PROJECT INTRODUCTION AND RATIONALE

The idea for Mentor Market was inspired by a real challenge I experienced during my web development course. Partway through the programme, structured mentor support was revoked, leaving many students without direct guidance at a critical stage of learning.

This highlighted how important accessible mentorship is, not only for technical support, but also for confidence, motivation and direction. As a learner transitioning into tech, I wanted to explore how a simple, structured platform could help connect students with experienced developers who are willing to share their knowledge.

Mentor Market was built as a practical learning project to apply real-world development concepts such as authentication, user roles, relational databases, form handling and booking logic. The project reflects both my technical progress and the personal experience that shaped its purpose.
